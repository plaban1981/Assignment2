"""
Circuit Breaker - Prevents cascading failures in distributed systems.
If a service keeps failing, we "open the circuit" and stop calling it.

States:
- CLOSED: Everything working normally, calls go through
- OPEN: Too many failures, all calls fail immediately
- HALF_OPEN: Testing if service recovered

    How it works:
    1. Start in CLOSED state (everything working)
    2. If failures reach threshold → OPEN (stop calling service)
    3. After timeout → HALF_OPEN (try one request)
    4. If HALF_OPEN request succeeds → CLOSED (recovered!)
    5. If HALF_OPEN request fails → OPEN again
    
    Example:
        >>> breaker = CircuitBreaker(max_failures=3, timeout=60)
        >>> result = breaker.call(lambda: api_call())
